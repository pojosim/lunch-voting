Voting system for deciding where to have lunch.
==

Design and implement a REST API using Hibernate/Spring/SpringMVC (or Spring-Boot) without frontend.

* 2 types of users: admin and regular users
* Admin can input a restaurant and it's lunch menu of the day (2-5 items usually, just a dish name and price)
* Menu changes each day (admins do the updates)
* Users can vote on which restaurant they want to have lunch at
* Only one vote counted per user
* If user votes again the same day:
  - If it is before 11:00 we assume that he changed his mind.
  - If it is after 11:00 then it is too late, vote can't be changed
    
Each restaurant provides a new menu each day.
